# Code of Conduct

All attendees, sponsors and organisers at our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## Need Help?

You can contact the organisers at organisers@studycode.org, or in person at an event.

## The Quick Version

Our group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any of our events, talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, nationality, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, from warning the offender or expulsion from the group.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact an organiser immediately. You can find the organisers on the meetup website, and they will introduce themselves at the beginning of the event.

Organisers will be happy to help attendees contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at events, workshop and group social events.
